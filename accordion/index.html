    <h1>High Sierra's Campgrounds</h1>
		<h2><a href="#">Tioga Lake Campgrounds</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>Situated at 9,700 feet above sea level and also upon two lakes. This campground is very beautiful yet it can get very cold at night. Even on sunny 80 degree days, the temperature can drop to 20 degrees and the wind can carry across the lakes. The senery however makes it worth it. Excellent hiking located nearby. A well water pump is located on site and the lakes are great for swimming on a warm summer day. Only 13 sites are available and are first come first served.

		<h2><a href="#">SandleBag Lake Resort Campgrounds</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>Don't let the name fool you! This rustic campsite is far from the usual resort, but is perfect for the nature lover who likes to completely detatch from civilization. Located at 10,000 feet above sea level and offers the best hiking around. The one modern touch that it does have is a water taxi that will take you across the lake to hike the almost untouched nature resort.</p>

		<h2><a href="#">Merced Lake Campgrounds</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>One of the original campsites located in Yosemite National Park and is also the most remote! It's perfect if you want to get away from crowds but still want to stay within the park. The campsite is located at 7,150 feet. With its relatively low elevation, it brings warmer days and nights. Near Tuolumne Meadows.
